# Metaheuristic-Optimization

This repository consists of 2 projects, both using different metaheuristic optimization algorithms to find the omptimum answers for some optimization problems.

## Black-Box-Optimization

This project compares the performance of grid search, random search, genetic algorithm, and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms on 3 blackbox problems.
More details are provided in the README.md file inside the project folder.



## Traveling-Salesman

This project compares the performance of grid search, random search, genetic algorithm, and differential evolution algorithms on a traveling salesman problem.
More details are provided in the README.md file inside the project folder.
